            "[LLM Answer]: Based on the context provided, where Apple’s revenue grew by 10% largely due to iPhone sales, it indicates that iPhone results are likely to remain strong. We could expect continued growth in iPhone sales driven by factors such as new product launches, increased demand in specific markets, or favorable consumer sentiment. However, to make a more accurate projection, it would also be important to consider other elements like market competition, pricing strategies, and overall economic conditions. If these factors remain positive, the iPhone results could show sustained or improved performance in the near future.\n"
